United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

@EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016

THANK YOU! #VoteTrump

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

"@johnkurkosky: @Carolde @The_Lady_Colors  @DRJAMESCABOT @TamiDurling @AceofSpadesHQ THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICAS FUTURE, VOTE TRUMP"

Thank you for your support last night, Iowa! #VoteTrump #Trump2016 #IACaucus #FITN #IAPolitics 

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

New CBS poll. #Trump2016

Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 

Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

THANK YOU! #Trump2016 

The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!

@stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don't blame Mitt! Now Stevens can't get a job!

Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson

@MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter!

Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!

Will be on @FallonTonight with @JimmyFallon on @NBC at 11:35pmE. Enjoy! #Trump2016

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

@RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.

Congratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview! Thank you!

Just arrived in New Hampshire. Thank you to all of my supporters!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!

Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!

Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him!

Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016 

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

"@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

(2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it! 

(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. 

@JonahNRO, watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you.

Thank you, @TheFix- Chris Cillizza. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right. 

Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!

Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.

#FoxNews Poll - THANK YOU!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Not good news for Jeb Bush  

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!

The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Hillary and her friends! Hillary and her friends! Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Don’t like @SamuelLJackson’s golf swing.  Not athletic. I’ve won many club championships. Play him for charity!

By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the 

Al-Shabaab terror video. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

"@barbaraslavin1: @RuthMarcus @washingtonpost bashing distinguished women journalists won't win you votes"  She is 3rd rate, a total dummy!

@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus, poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying

@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before." Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

 Donald J. Trump, Lara Trump und Daniel Scavino Jr.

Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!

Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump2016 

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: https://m.facebook.com/DonaldTrump

Thank you so much to http://WND.com  for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me!

Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

We need a real President! Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 

Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!

"@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you!"  Thank you.

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00. Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects. Enjoy!

I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Thank you! #Trump2016

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!

"@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Story: 

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.

@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

"@ClassySnobbb: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm reading #CrippledAmerica! Best book ever. Thank you!

When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!

@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

"@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True, a total distortion of the facts!

I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!

Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

"@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail

Story: 

"@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."

"@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."  Good question!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

 Jeff Greenfield ‏@greenfield64  22. Dez. 2015 

On further review, Trump is right on this. "I got schlonged" is a commonplace NY way of saying: "I lost big time," w/out genital reference.

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy

Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.

"@qbeacademy: Well I'm at 42% and your at 3% .You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage.  Classic"

@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.

Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?

Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?

@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!

Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.

Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.

Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!

Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!

I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.

Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology!

Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!

It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!

Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!

@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!

Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press

Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it

Great news in Georgia!  The just out  Landmark poll shows me in first with 43%! Wow. 

Our spectacular ballroom under construction at the great Turnberry resort in Scotland. @chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning!  I fixed his rating problem.

@Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time

@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!

Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!

@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!

"@theratzpack: @PattonDivision if only we had a leader like this. We will soon. DonaldTrump will look out for the interests of Americans.

Heading to Manassas, Virginia, for a rally. Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings. So sad!

#TeamTrump. Police and law enforcement seem to have killed one of the California shooters and are in a shootout with the others. Go police

California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!

Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.

You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record, almost all polls showed I won all debates.

Highly untalented Wash Post blogger, Jennifer Rubin, a real dummy, never writes fairly about me. Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?

What is Obama thinking? Curtis Sliwa - doing tv commentary on 9/13/2001. Good job Curtis. Please send your apologies to @realDonaldTrump. 

Look at the editorial I was just sent from the NY Post on 9/14/01 - 3 days after collapse of WTC. Any apologies? 

Jamiel Shaw was incredible on @foxandfriends this morning. His son, who was viciously killed by an illegal immigrant, is so proud of pop!

I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception. What a crowd of incredible people!

Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing. Wonderful news conference followed. Now off to Georgia for big speech!

We need a great leader- now! We better be vigilant, careful, and strong.

@chrissyteigen Wow! Trashy gutter mouth woman. You can't hold a candle2 @MELANIATRUMP when it comes2 beauty and eloquence @realDonaldTrump

The Republican establishment, out of self preservation, is concerned w/ my high poll #'s. More concerned are Dems—I beat Hillary heads up!

How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!

Wow, the MSM is really going after me. 12,000 in Sarasota, a love fest, hardly a mention. Only one negativity - they only want negatives!

"@charlottepturn: @Morning_Joe THERE WERE NO VIDEO CELL PHONES!IS AreUall looking4bonus?Near StJoes Hosp Paterson NJ Arab area outside celeb

"@wzpd8z: Mr. Trump, Chuck Todd is a moron, all kinds of youtube videos showing muslims celebrating 911. I would show it on your ads."

"@wompol: @realDonaldTrump @CNN we also saw numerous (since scrubbed) videos of celebrations on 9/11"

When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis, who doesn't have a clue! Others bad also.

"@BeckyOmz: @JuvenIle  @thehill We could use a new era of greatness! America needs to return to its place in the world--leading!"

"@Barber2012Jeff: @realDonaldTrump John Kasich-it didn't work I'm still voting for #Trump" John has done so poorly in the debates he's done!

Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC. You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are. You will be right!

"@boogiefinger: @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress @chucktodd Chuck doesn't know that 100,000 x 2 = 200,000 "

After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!

Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.

Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC. Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. Just another sad case

"@thatx209xguy: @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller Trump is our last hope to make America great again. #Trump2016" So true!

"@Allibiis: @realDonaldTrump @ArtPar17 @CNN story is bogus. Donald Trump has the most diverse group of voters/supporters in the GOP field."

@CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring

"@Pablo44x: @CNN @realDonaldTrump Another hit piece by CNN. "What? We're not biased!""

I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning. So much to talk about!

"@ArtPar17: @CNN   Your story is a total fraud"  I agree!

"@JacoH: @CNN @realDonaldTrump I can't believe how low CNN can go. Obviously a bunch of Killary fans." @CNN only says negative-bad reporters

The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!

@CNN Kayleigh McEnany was great on you network today. You should have her  on more often! Thank you Kayleigh for your nice words.
